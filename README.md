# Intro

The Caesar cipher is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers in the world of cryptography. As I am a beginner in cryptography I was exposed to this new topic called Ceaser cipher. So I decided to code a python program called caesar_cipher.py in the intention of giving something back to the hacker/programmer community from the things I have learned from the online community :) :) :) ...

prerequisites: Python3

USAGE:
python3 caesar_cipher.py
